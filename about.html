I find HTML/CSS/Javascript to be accessible for learning and practicing independently and I'm amazed by the quantity of resources online. Continued inspiration comes from Azheem Azhar's <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/" target="_blank">Exponential View</a> and The Internet Archive trove of <a href="https://archive.org/details/computerchronicles" target="_blank"> Computer Chronicles</a> (You're welcome)
